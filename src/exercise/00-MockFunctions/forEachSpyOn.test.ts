/* Exercise 0: Test the function by using a spyOn function */

/* Mock the function using spyOn
Write four tests inside a describe block. Do not forget to use the beforeEach function to clear the mock function.
The mock function receives a prop of type number. The mocked function adds a 6 to the number.
1. First Test: 
The forEach function should be called 3 times
2. Second Test:
The forEach function should be called with the correct arguments.
3. Third Test:
Test the first argument of the first call to the function was 0 and the result is 6.
Test the first argument of the second call to the function was 1  and the result is 7.
4. Forth Test:
Test the first argument of the third call to the function was 4 and the result is not 9.
